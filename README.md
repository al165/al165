Hello! I am an Amsterdam-based creative coder who collaborates with artist, designers, musicians and theater makers to build multi-media and computational art works, installations and performances.

I am a long-term member of the design collective [ARK](https://ark.amsterdam), where our work [LAWKI](https://lawki.online) has appeared in exhibitions around The Netherlands and in Taiwan, as well as [winning](https://www.filmfestival.nl/en/film/lawki-life-as-we-know-it) the NFF Golden Kalf for Digital Culture Production.

I am the former [coding](https://arranlyon.com/coding) tutor of Year 1 Graphic Design at KABK, The Hague.

My specialties are python, data science, audio/dsp, web front and backend, C++, embedded systems, and getting all of these systems talking to each other.

**I'm currently working on...**
  - [Plugins, plugins, plugins](https://github.com/ThunderboomRecords/WAIVE)
  - [Marginalia](https://github.com/al165/MarginaliaDemo), a radical annotation and publishing tool.

**I'm currently looking to collaborate on...**
  - Building more audio plugins.
  - Experimental music software and performance projects.
  - Installation and interactive art works.


When I am not coding, I'm often on some long distant [biking adventure](https://whereis.arranlyon.com).
